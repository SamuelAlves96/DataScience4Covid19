    "This work is part of a task with the intention to use Machine Learning on Covid-19 datasets.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    " Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a new strain of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus that is currently sweeping through the world making a huge impact on the livelihood of most people. Due to its relatively high infectivity and the fact that symptoms of this disease take a long time to be manifested, special measures had to be taken everywhere which include using face masks, washing everything with sanitized alcohol, practicing social distancing and even more drastic measures like putting an entire country in lockdown. The arrival of this new disease has had terrible consequences on the economy of many countries, since the virus started spreading to the rest of the world around March 2020 many establishments have struggled to stay in business and all social events have been prohibited by the government.\n",
    " \n",
    " Due to the aforementioned measures taken there is a growing number of people that don not believe the negative effects that a disease like this has on the mortality rate using the argument that it is just the flu because the symptoms of this disease are similar to an influenza virus infection. However, this is a statement that has little scientific basis, and using machine learning algorithms it is possible to predict how the mortality rate will vary using data that has already been recorded [1].\n",
    " \n",
    " The main goal of this work is to prove that the coronavirus is a disease that can have serious consequences in rising mortality rate and that it is not just a typical flu infectious disease.\n",
    " \n",
    " This analysis consists in using 2 datasets: the main one which has data for every state in the USA containing the number of deaths by Covid-19, Influenza and Pneumonia with their age group and week and a second one that has more information about deaths of Covid-19.\n",
    " \n",
    " These datasets will be used to build a machine learning model used to predict future deaths caused by influenza, pneumonia and covid-19.\n",
